This project looked at the effects of social environment (e.g., parental affectedness of autism traits) and stimulus type (cartoon schematic vs realistic live action) on early attention to faces during the first postnatal year. 
The aim was to see whether developmental trajectories in attention to faces varied for infants at high versus low risk for autism spectrum disorders.
